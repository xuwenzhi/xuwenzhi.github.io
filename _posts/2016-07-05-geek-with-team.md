## Why Work as a Team?

- Human factors often play a larger role in project success
- Hiding is harmful; solo efforts often lead to disappointing results
- Communicating early and not hiding things often reduces the probability of failure
- Ensure failures happen early, fast, and frequently
- Software development is a collective endeavor

> Working in isolation often yields no results. The reason might be that what you're building was wrong from the start because it was too subjective, or you might miss communication opportunities with others and become outdated.

## The Most Important Factor for a Team: Culture!

- Culture is born for the team's goals! This applies to everything from a nation to a small team!

## What is Team Culture?

Culture is typically an abstract concept. So what does culture mean for an engineering team? Simply put, it's the universal practices or traditions of team members, such as team members' values, goals, sense of identity, code reviews, test-driven development, or Friday night board game activities. All of these are forms of culture.

## How to Build Team Culture & How to Protect It?

Team culture is usually created consciously or unconsciously by the founding team. As the team grows, this culture gradually persists, continuously absorbing good things and discarding bad ones.

However, there's a saying: "It's easier to conquer a kingdom than to keep it." This saying makes sense because teams will always have new blood, and new blood doesn't necessarily mean there's nothing harmful. At this time, if the team culture isn't "strong" enough, a "one bad apple spoils the barrel" phenomenon may occur. So protecting culture mostly depends on whether the team culture is deep enough and whether senior members can step up to protect this hard-won team culture.

## Team Members?

- Constructive criticism, no mockery
- The fewer people in synchronous communication (face-to-face meetings), the better; the more people in asynchronous communication (email lists), the better
- Write a mission statement for major projects to keep goals clear and let other members know, achieving harmony while respecting differences

## How to Be a Technical Leader?

Be a servant leader. Don't start with a bang when taking office. A leader's most important job is to serve the team and work hard to create an atmosphere of humility, respect, and trust.

## Don't:

- Don't hire yes-men: Hire people who are smarter than you and can replace you. Although they may challenge you sometimes, they will also deliver excellent work.
- Don't ignore underperformers: Often one or two underperformers prevent the team from advancing further.
- Don't ignore interpersonal relationships
- Don't be friends with everyone: If you want to be a strong leader, you can have casual chats with everyone over lunch.
- Don't lower hiring standards
- Don't treat the team like children: Give the team full control

## A Leader's Way of Life

- Let go of ego
- Be a Zen master: Stay calm at all times
- Be a catalyst for the team
- Be a mentor
- Set clear goals
- Be honest: Avoid the compliment sandwich method
- Others: Know when to be the bad guy; Protect the team

## Bad Apples

- Disrespecting others' time
- Arrogance
- Excessive demands
- Childish or nonsensical communication
- Paranoia
- Perfectionism
